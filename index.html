        I am Daveson Birri, everyone calls me Dave in short. I am doing this course to help overcome my fear of being left
        behind as the world digs deeper in the realm of computers and AI, lol. I have a huge desire to become a programmer one
        day and hopefully I get there through my studies here. I have a family of four made up of my wife Cynthia, my two
        daughters, Nenyasha (5) and Ryleigh (3) and of causee myself included and we are members of the LDS church. We are from
        Zimbabwe, however, we currently reside in South Africa, Pretoria. I work in the hospitality industry as a manager for a
        guest house and my dream is to have my own hotel and probably write the programs for the daily operations. I recently
        realized that I am actively involved in running although I do not describe myself as an athlete, I run a lot and my
        favorite sport is Basketball and the F1, for the Mercedes team. I am greatful to be learning this program with all of
        you and I look forward to meeting you all. Thank you.
